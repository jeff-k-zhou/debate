                                    Britney Griner is a WNBA basketball player who was traded with Viktor Bout, a Russian Arms dealer. This trade is a 
                                    loss for America and should have never happened.

                                    Britney Griner was arrested under "drug-smuggling" charges with little proof released from Russia. It is true that Griner
                                    was most likely wrongfully detained, but trading the "Merchant of Death" arms dealer Viktor Bout for a basketball player is a 
                                    tremendous mistake for the US. Viktor Bout is pure evil for conspiring with terrorist orginizations and supporting the Russian invasion
                                    of Ukraine "full-heartedly".

                                    Biden, who claims that Griner is an icon to Americans, is not completely wrong in his statement. However, the trade is completely advantageous
                                    towards Russia, who just received a crazed Putin-smoocher that would happily wreak more havoc in the US, which is helpful for Russia.
                                    Biden should have instead at least bartered with Russia to get Griner and a wrongfully detained marine back for Viktor Bout. 
                                    Biden's trade represents a worldview that icons are more important than people who have sacrificed their livelihoods for this country, and that
                                    we are allowed to go as far to trade a terrorist for an icon.

                                In recent months, Iran has had and currently does have a lot of protests going around over the death of Mahsa and the execution of Shekari. These recent protests are a start of something great that can finally change how the regime of Iran looks at its people.

                                Many people in Iran have been outraged due to the death of one Mahsa for wearing her hijab incorrectly and the first execution of a person due to protesting. These reasons give them all the right to protests and this isnâ€™t including the many deaths that have happened in between. This is supported even more by the fact Shekari did not get due process or even a lawyer.

                                Even European officials have even criticized that Iran is abusing the power they have over the country by not treating them fair or equally. The past president even stated that they should be more cooperative and listen to the protesters. The way Iran uses its power is seen by everyone and is under investigations.They should be found guilty of human rights violations and be replaced with a much better regime over the country to balance it.
