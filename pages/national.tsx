                                    On December 13th, Joe Biden signs a law that protects same-sex and interracial marriages. After several decades of discrimination, this laws makes it so every state has to recognize and treat these marriages as legal marriages.

                                    This law now officially voids the DOMA law and shows that many people around the nation support the LGBTQ rights and this law with 68% of people supporting it. Biden has warned Justice Thomas that Roe v Wade was leading them in a dangerous path for them when it comes to marriage equality. He later talks about how he supports equality in marriages and that heâ€™s evolved as a politician for when he was a Senator, he was cautious when it came to LGBT issues but now is comfortable with them. He became a heavy supporter of them and invited prominent members of the LGBT community during the passing of the law.

                                    Republicans are pushing a last-minute immigration framework that would increase border security funding and would give
                                    two million illegal immigrants a pathway to US Citizenship. Both immigration hawks and Democrats oppose this framework for different reasons.

                                    Democrats claim that the new immigration policy is an "attack on asylum seekers" because of its heavier border control policies
                                    and greater funding for deportation resources. "The proposed plan would reinstate the Title 42 expulsion policy while significantly increasing funding for border security. It bolsters a deal to further militarize the border and lacks necessary accountability measures that comprehensive immigration reform would have delivered,"
                                    Jose Correra, a House Democrat, said.

                                    Immigration hawks, on the other hand, dislike the new policy&apos;s amnesty towards current illegal immigrants. They believe that all illegal immigrants should
                                    be deported. It will be hard to garner support for this plan in both parties as Title 42, which expels immigrants at the border
                                    due to COVID-19 risks, will expire in the following two weeks.
